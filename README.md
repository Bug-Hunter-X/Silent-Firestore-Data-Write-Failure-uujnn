This repository demonstrates a rare Firebase Firestore bug where data write operations appear successful but fail to persist data in the database. The bug.js file contains the problematic code, and bugSolution.js provides the corrected version with a solution to address this issue.  The core problem is related to asynchronous operations and improper handling of promises, leading to a situation where the write appears to be complete but actually hasn't been fully committed.
